# C.G.P.A Deviser

**Course:** Java

**Java Project to devise a simple study plan for engineering students.**

An Application which calculates S.G.P.A for the student's current semester and recommends S.G.P.A scoring plans for the student's upcoming semesters. The Recommendation system works based on the student's current S.G.P.A and the **Target C.G.P.A** entered by the Student.

**Target C.G.P.A** - It is the C.G.P.A which the student aims to score at the final semester of Engineering.


So based on the student's **Target C.G.P.A** several scoring plans will be devised by the application. All the devised plans will be written into a file for future references.

### CONCEPTS AND FRAMEWORKS USED TO BUILD THE PROJECT
**Concepts:**

- Exception handling (RunTime Exception Handling)
- Inheritence
- Type Wrappers
- File handling
- String handling

**Collection Framworks:**

- Arrays
- ArrayList
- LinkedHashMap
- Lists
- Sets

### FEATURES OF THE PROJECT

The Appication's functionality is classified into two parts:
1. The application calculates S.G.P.A for the Student's current semester and outputs the Final SEE (Semester-End Examination) and  CIE (Continuous Internal Evaluation) marks into a file in a proper tabulated manner.
2. Based on the **Target C.G.P.A** entered by the student, the application formulates several possible plans to achieve the *Target C.G.P.A* of the student. Then the application outputs the plans into a file for future references.
